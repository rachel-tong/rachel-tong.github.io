        <p>
        	My name is Rachel Tong, and I'm an aspiring professional engineer in the biomedical engineering and medical device industry. One area I am interested in is neuroengineering.
        	Throughout college, I worked in Neural Interfaces Research, researching and developing devices that can record information from the brain and also target specific neurons for stimulation. I have
        	hands-on experience with in-vivo animal experiments testing our devices and collecting data from them.
        	I hope to take the skills and knowledge from that experience to fuel additional learning in the field of neuroengineering.
        </p>
        <p>
			I am also interested in orthopedic biomechanics. My passion for orthopedics stems from my own experiences as I have two metal plates in my forearm from when I broke my arm in gymnastics.
			That surgery allowed me to heal effectively and completely, and allowed me to continue as a gymnast. This is what generated my initial interest in biomedical engineering - it made me want
			to make devices that could help other people, just like someone created this device to help me.
        </p>

        	I thoroughly enjoy working on difficult problems and pushing the edge of technology. With that, I really like working with people - I've found it an effective way 
        	to not only gain new skills but also teach others what I have learned. In the past, I was a Teaching Assistant at the University of Wisconsin, where I mentored young
        	engineers learn the skills to help solve future healthcare problems.
